Flu Shot Learning: Predicting Vaccination Patterns
Project Overview
In this project, you will develop machine learning models to predict whether individuals received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on their demographic information, social factors, beliefs, and behaviors. This project addresses a crucial public health challenge: understanding what factors influence vaccination decisions to improve future vaccination campaigns.

Competition Link
DrivenData - Flu Shot Learning Competition

Project Goals
Develop classification models to predict two target variables:
Whether a person received the H1N1 vaccine
Whether a person received the seasonal flu vaccine
Analyze which factors most strongly influence vaccination decisions
Create visualizations that effectively communicate your findings
Deploy a simple dashboard showcasing your models and insights
Data Description
Dataset Source
The data comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS), conducted by the CDC between October 2009 and June 2010 during the "swine flu" pandemic.

Features Overview
The dataset contains 36 columns representing:

Demographic variables (age, income, education, etc.)
Social indicators (geographic region, household composition)
Opinions and perceptions about vaccines and disease risk
Behavioral indicators (preventive health measures taken)
Target Variables
h1n1_vaccine: Whether the respondent received the H1N1 vaccine (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
seasonal_vaccine: Whether the respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Project Structure
Sprint 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (3 weeks)
Clean and preprocess the dataset
Handle missing values and categorical variables
Visualize patterns and correlations in the data
Analyze distributions of key variables
Deliverable: EDA report with visualizations and initial insights
Sprint 2: Model Development (3 weeks)
Feature engineering and selection
Train baseline classification models for both target variables
Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
Evaluate models using ROC AUC metric
Deliverable: Trained models with documented performance metrics
Sprint 3: Insights & Deployment (3 weeks)
Analyze feature importance and model explanations
Create a Streamlit dashboard to visualize predictions and insights
Document findings and recommendations for public health strategies
Deliverable: Interactive dashboard and final presentation
Technical Requirements
Required Technologies
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn)
Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and documentation
GitHub for version control
Streamlit for dashboard creation
Performance Metric
ROC AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve)
Final score is the average ROC AUC across both prediction targets

Mentoring Structure
Volunteers will provide consistent guidance throughout the project. Your mentors will:

Provide technical support during weekly sessions
Review your code and give specific feedback
Help troubleshoot challenges
Guide your analysis toward meaningful insights
Team Organization
Teams will consist of 2-3 students
Each team should designate roles:
Data preprocessing lead
Modeling specialist
Visualization/dashboard developer
(Roles can overlap depending on team size)
Important Notes
Data Use Restrictions
As per CDC guidelines:

Use the data for statistical reporting and analysis only
Do not attempt to identify individuals in the dataset
Do not link this data with other individually identifiable datasets
Ethical Considerations
Consider how your findings might impact public health policy
Reflect on implications for vaccine hesitancy and health communication
Discuss potential biases in the data and how they might affect your conclusions
Extensions for Advanced Students
Implement ensemble methods combining multiple models
Develop more advanced feature engineering techniques
Create a more sophisticated interactive dashboard
Conduct causal inference analysis on specific features
